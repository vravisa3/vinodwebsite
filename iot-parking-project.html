            <p class="meta-info team-info"><em>Team members: Gopi Krishnan S and Vinod Krishnaa Ravisankar</em></p>
            
            <p>Finding parking spots on busy college campuses wastes time and creates congestion, especially during peak hours when students, faculty, and visitors all arrive together. This project proposes a smart parking solution for Coimbatore Institute of Technology (CIT) using IoT sensors and LoRaWAN wireless tech to show real-time availability on a mobile app—this is a student concept design with lab prototype, not a live campus system.</p>
            
            <p>The simple idea places ultrasonic sensors above each parking slot to detect if a car is present, connected to Arduino boards with LoRa shields for long-range, low-power wireless communication. Data flows to a central LoRa gateway, then to a cloud server and user app showing green (available) or red (occupied) spots across campus lots. It also includes automatic number plate recognition at entry gates for security and vehicle logging.</p>
            
            <p>A lab prototype tested one parking slot: the sensor reliably detected cars, sent status updates through LoRa to a phone app within seconds. Campus layout analysis identified key lots near library and main buildings (total ~7,800 m² for 150+ cars), with rubberized paver blocks recommended for durable, eco-friendly surfaces using recycled tire rubber. Civil design followed IRC standards for slot sizes (5m x 2.5m) and Wet Mix Macadam base.</p>
            
            <p>This shows affordable IoT can cut search time, optimize space use (reduce circling by 30-50%), and improve security—but it’s prototype-level only. Real deployment would need weatherproof sensors, campus-wide power/internet, app scaling for 1,000+ users, and integration with payment systems. Next steps: field test multiple slots, add solar power, and expand to full campus coverage with analytics for peak-hour planning.</p>
